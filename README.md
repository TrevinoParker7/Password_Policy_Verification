# 🕶️ LAB: Password Policy Verification 

> “You take the blue pill — the audit stays in Excel.  
> You take the red pill — and I show you how deep the password policy goes.”  
> — Morpheus, GRC Division

## 🧠 The Premise

You’ve spent years trapped inside **Excel**, believing compliance was just checklists and screenshots.  
But now, Neo… you’re about to wake up in **The Compliance Matrix** — a realm where **Python**, **AWS**, and **JSON evidence** break the chains of manual audits.

This lab is your **escape plan**.

---

## 💾 Mission Brief

Your objective:  
Prove you can bridge the gap between *compliance requirements* and *real technical evidence*.  

In this simulation, you’ll validate **AWS Password Policies** — both **old-school IAM** and **modern AWS Identity Center** — and generate **audit-ready evidence** like a true GRC engineer.

---

## 🕶️ Why It Matters

Because every **auditor**, **compliance officer**, and **hiring manager** is basically standing over your desk saying:

> “Show me your password policy.”

Most people panic, take a screenshot, and pray.  
But you? You’ll calmly hand them a **JSON** and **CSV** report mapped to **SOC 2 CC6.2** and **NIST IA-5**.  
And Morpheus will nod in slow motion.

## ⚙️ How This Lab Frees You From the Matrix

### 🧱 For Your Portfolio
Tired of saying “I know compliance”?  
Now you can *show* it — with tangible, auditable, JSON-powered proof that you can automate AWS evidence.  
When someone asks what you’ve done in AWS, you won’t show screenshots — you’ll show **machine-verified truth**.

### 🧑‍💼 For Interviews
Interviewers love to ask:  
> “How do you make compliance operational?”

You’ll respond:
> “I built a Python-based password verification engine that outputs JSON and CSV mapped to SOC 2 and NIST. Boom.”

Then lean back and let the Matrix code rain behind you.

### 💼 For LinkedIn
Flex your GRC superpowers with something like:

> “Just finished a GRC Engineering lab where I automated AWS password policy verification.  
> Instead of screenshots, I generated JSON and CSV evidence mapped to SOC 2 and NIST.  
> Compliance is no longer manual — it’s engineered.”

Result: 🚀 100 likes, 🧠 10 recruiters in your inbox, and one **Oracle** commenting “You’re The One.”
